# vultr-imageless
An imageless app template for making imageless Marketplace app for Vultr.

imageless_tools.sh currently contains only the tools to generate binaries but will include
other functions to make creating images easier in the future as needed.

The output sh file can be opened in a text editor and copied and pasted into the imageless
text field on your Marketplace app's builds page. Remember to be careful and use appropriate
text editors as carriage returns may cause issues on linux systems if you are building from
Windows.
